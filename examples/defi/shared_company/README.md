# SharedCompany 

This example is build for the demonstration of two things:

How a "SharedCompany" aka an infant DAO / a company governed by its shareholders could work. 
Show how a "Proposal" aka the decision mechanism for such a company could work.

It is only a prototype so there a features missing which would be highly relevant for a working SharedCompany.
Additionaly, security was not the focus so there are obvious attack vectors that are not covered. 

I hope this prototypes helps others to learn Scrypto and gives a rough idea how these systems could be designed. 

Cheers, Miro
